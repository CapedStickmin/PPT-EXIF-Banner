# PowerPoint Batch Banner Generation Macro for Photo Parameters

This is a PowerPoint VBA macro designed for photography enthusiasts and professionals. It can **batch process** multiple photos, automatically creating a new slide for each one and adding a professional, aesthetically pleasing banner with the photo's shooting parameters.

By pre-loading a CSV data file generated by ExifTool, this macro completely resolves EXIF data reading failures caused by system environment differences, ensuring extremely high operational stability and efficiency.

## Core Features

*   **Batch Processing**: Supports selecting multiple photos at once. The macro automatically creates a new slide for each photo and adds a banner, significantly improving efficiency.
*   **Excellent Performance**: Utilizes a one-time data loading mechanism. After the first run, all photo data is loaded into memory, ensuring swift responses even when processing a large number of photos.
*   **High Stability**: Bypasses compatibility issues by reading from an external CSV file instead of parsing image files directly.
*   **Intelligent Reporting**: After batch processing is complete, a clear report is provided, indicating how many files were processed successfully and which were skipped due to missing data.
*   **Professional Appearance**: Automatically adds a shadow effect to the images. The banner features a semi-transparent design with carefully arranged fonts and layout.
*   **Highly Configurable**: Users can easily modify the logo path, data file path, and fine-tune the banner layout.

## Workflow

Please strictly follow the four steps below for configuration and usage.

### Step 1: Preparation

1.  **ExifTool**: Download the `ExifTool` executable for Windows. After downloading from the official website ([https://exiftool.org/](https://exiftool.org/)), rename the `exiftool(-k).exe` file to `exiftool.exe`.
2.  **Camera Logo**:
    *   **Online Image (Default)**: The code uses an online Nikon logo link by default, which is convenient but requires an internet connection.
    *   **Local Image (Recommended)**: For faster loading speeds and offline convenience, it is recommended to download the logo image to your local machine and update the file path in the code (e.g., `C:\MyLogos\Nikon.jpg`).
    *   **Other Brands**: You can change the logo to that of another brand. This script does not support automatically switching camera brands.

### Step 2: Generate EXIF Data File

This is the most critical step in the entire process.

1.  Copy the `exiftool.exe` file into the root folder where **all** your photos are stored (e.g., `E:\images`).
2.  In that folder, hold down the `Shift` key and right-click, then select "Open PowerShell window here" or "Open command prompt here".
3.  **Sequentially** enter and execute the following two commands:

    *   The first command ensures that the command line can correctly handle Chinese characters:
      ```bash
      chcp 65001
      ```

    *   The second command runs ExifTool to scan all photos and generate the data file `exif_data.csv`:
      ```bash
      .\exiftool.exe -csv -r -charset filename=utf8 -FileName -Model -LensID -FocalLength -FNumber -ExposureTime -ISO . > exif_data.csv
      ```

4.  **Important**: After the command runs successfully, open the newly generated `exif_data.csv` file with **Notepad**. Then, select **File -> Save As**. In the dialog that appears, change the **Encoding** at the bottom to **`UTF-8 with BOM`**, then save and overwrite the original file. This step ensures that VBA can read the file content correctly.

### Step 3: Install and Configure the Macro in PowerPoint

1.  Open PowerPoint and press `Alt + F11` to enter the VBA Editor.
2.  In the editor's menu bar, click **Insert -> Module** to create a new, empty code module.
3.  Copy and paste the entire **[Complete Macro Code]** below into this new module.
4.  **Modify Configuration**: At the very top of the code, find and modify the following two constant lines, replacing the paths with your own actual paths:
    ```vb
    Const NIKON_LOGO_PATH As String = "https://i1.wp.com/..." ' Or change to a local path "C:\path\to\your\logo.jpg"
    Const CSV_FILE_PATH As String = "D:\path\to\your\photos\exif_data.csv"
    ```
5.  **Add a Shortcut (Recommended)**:
    *   Return to the main PowerPoint interface and click **File -> Options -> Quick Access Toolbar**.
    *   From the "Choose commands from" dropdown menu, select "Macros".
    *   Find the macro named `CreateBannersOnNewSlides_Batch` and click "Add".
    *   You can click "Modify" to choose a preferred icon for it.
    *   Click "OK" to save.

### Step 4: Run the Macro

Click the icon you just added to the Quick Access Toolbar. In the window that pops up, **hold down the `Ctrl` or `Shift` key to select one or more** photos you wish to insert, then click "Open" to begin the batch processing.

## Fine-Tuning

You can easily fine-tune the banner's layout to achieve the best visual effect. Find the `PositionAndCreateLayout` subroutine in the VBA code to make modifications.

**The following parameters have been adjusted by the author for optimal aesthetics, but you can modify them to suit your needs.**

1.  **Banner Width**:
    ```vb
    ' --- [Banner Width Adjustment] ---
    Const FIXED_BANNER_WIDTH As Single = 600 ' <-- Modify the width you desire here
    ```

2.  **Margin Between the Image and the Top/Bottom of the Slide (Safe Area)**:
    ```vb
    ' --- [Safe Area Adjustment] ---
    ' 0.87 means the total height of the image and banner will occupy at most 87% of the slide's height.
    ' Note that this whitespace includes the banner area.
    safeHeight = sldHeight * 0.87
    ```
